# Component test snippet

To add this to your snippets open vscode command pallet (ctrl-shift p) and select Preferences: Configure User Snippets.  You can either add this to your project level or global snippets, but add the contents of componentTestSnippet.code-snippets into the snippet object.

Once added, you can create a new test file with name matching the name of the component you are testing.  Then inside the test file press ctrl-space, and start typing "component" until you see the snippet.  Press enter on the snippet and the boilerplate will be created for you.
