# Informera

Informera is an RSS reader web application built using the React JavaScript library. It provides an interface through which users can subscribe to available feeds or add new RSS feeds. All data sources are combined into one central list. As configuration settings are stored locally on users' computers, no logins or accounts are required to use Informera. 

The project is broken up into two parts. The main application is found in the 'client' folder and contains the user interface and all related logic. The second part is a server that handles requests to the RSS sources and passes the returned data back to the main application. The server is found in the 'server' folder.

Both the 'client' and 'sever' folders have their own README files with detailed instructions on configuring and running the applications.
